Lynn Gardiner
Lynn Gardiner watched a dance show at school that rocked her world and started classes immediately at age 7.  At 8, she began her performing career. Lynn has studied jazz, tap, ballet, acrobatics, modern and hip hop. At 17, she discovered the joy of social dancing at salsa and swing clubs.  Lynn graduated from Cal State Hayward, trilingual, with degrees in Spanish and American Sign Language while all the while, taking part in choreography classes and performance opportunities to develop her dance growth and continue being part of the dance community throughout college. After college, Lynn’s discovery of ballroom brought her to new heights of performing, competing, traveling and coaching. Always at home on the stage, and showered with 1sts for amateur rhythm competitions, Lynn stepped up her passion for ballroom dancing by taking Diane Jarmolow’s Ballroom Teacher’s Dance College so she could articulate and share her Rhythm, Latin, Smooth and Standard training with her future students. Since age 7, she’s dreamed of this. And now at 30, educated, well-rounded, and glad to give back to the Bay Area, students can learn with Lynn! She teaches private lessons and is the primary instructor for the Wedding Dance Program at Just Dance Ballroom.
