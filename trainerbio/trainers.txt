I walked to the gym this morning. Its all uphill. Makes for good cardio warm up on the way there. The better thing is home is all down hill so it makes it feel like I'm almost falling home when the muscle has turned to jelly.


 I Booked a personal trainer for Friday morning just to get accurate measurements for my baseline. So even though I am working out this week I will take the 12 week program as starting from when i have accurate measurements. That way everything fits in to the equation.


So it was Chest and triceps today. I may need assistance washing my hair by tomorrow. I seem to feel more pain from upper body workouts than I do from lower. However I got to do tricep pulldowns on the rope. I may be a masochist but I enjoy the burn at failure on triceps. Complete contrast to the pain i feel from chest workouts. As long as i keep focussing on the fact that the pain im feeling means that those body parts need it more and will benefit more from it then it will just become as enjoyable as the workouts i look forward to.


Shower food and nap time. Cardio tomorrow.


Stay happy.
