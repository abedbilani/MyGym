                Sarah teaches a blend of Hatha Yoga, integrating Kripalu, Ashtanga and Kundalini into her practice. 
                She believes in the invigorating power that yoga offers the mind, body and spirit.
                Sarah Kline grew up in the Bahama Islands living on a boat with her parents who were writing and editing a guide for Yachtsman.
                She holds a B.A. in French and a Masters in Psychology and Counseling.
                She began her practice of yoga in the early 1990's when she traveled to Lenox, 
                Massachusetts to study at the Kripalu Center. 
                Sarah's Hatha practice is inspired by the teachings of her instructors;
                Stephen Cope, Shiva Rea, David Swensen & Shelley Washington, Rama Birch,
                Andrea Boyd & Jeffrey Cohen, Tom & Noele Pace. 
                Sarah views life as dynamic and believes that the key is to stay flexible.
                She is focused on caring for the human body as well as attending to relationships that support our lives. 
                For Sarah, becoming flexible mentally and physically begins on her yoga mat. 
                Sarah's favorite pose is Urdhva Dhanurasana (upward facing bow pose). 
                Regular practice of this pose keeps the body supple and creates a feeling of vitality and lightness,
                stimulating the adrenal glands and thus increasing one's will power and capacity to bear stress.</td></tr>
